The program was written for the first competition in Numerical Analysis.

To run this program run main.py file:
python3 main.py
py main.py

Instructions for the const.py file:
-   Set IMAGE_PATH as the path to the image to be replicated.
-   Choose BASE_COLOR, ACTIVE_COLOR, MASTER_COLOR, BACKGROUND_COLOR
    to ensure that the drawn curves are clearly visible.
-   Enable AA (Antialiasing).
-   Set CURVES_PATH as the path to the folder containing the program's results.

Drawing instructions:
-   Right mouse button: add a new point
-   Left mouse button: select and move a point
-   Left Ctrl: add a new curve
-   Left Shift: switch to the sub-layer mode
-   Delete: delete the selected point
